# Craze
Next generation CSS.

Instead of transpiling directly to CSS like most preprocessors, Craze compiles to a SPV (Selector, Property, Value) tree, which can then be compiled to CSS.

This allows more opportunities for middleware to interact with the CSS directly through a easy interface.

## Installation
```
$ npm install -g craze
```
